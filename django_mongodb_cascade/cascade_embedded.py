class cascade_embedded(object):
    """Cascade saves and deletes to related models.

    When one model is embedded in another, it will not be updated if the
    instance of the embedded model is changed. This class decorator
    incorporates post_save and post_delete signals into the decorated model.

    Example:
    >>>@cascade_embedded("account.Organization", "user_profile")
    >>>class UserProfile(models.Model)

    Required Arguments:
    :param target_model: The model that is embedding this model, and
            that will be updated with the changes to this model's instances.
    :param field_name: The name of the field that will contain the embedded
            instance in the target model.

    Options:
    :param pre_save_function: A function to execute before each embedded
            instance is saved in the target model
    :param post_save_function: A function to execute after each embedded
            instance is saved in the target model. This is attempted
            regardless of any exceptions that are raised during saving.
    :param override_save_function: This library creates a function that runs
            during a "Post Save" Django signal. The user can override that
            by providing a function here.
            The user can also provide the value "None". In that case, no
            post_save signal will be attached at all.

    :param pre_delete_function:  A function to execute before each embedded
            instance is deleted from the target model
    :param post_delete_function: A function to execute after each embedded
            instance is deleted in the target model. This is attempted
            regardless of any exceptions that are raised during saving.
    :param override_delete_function: This library creates a function that runs
            during a "Post Delete" Django signal. The user can override that
            by providing a function here.
            The user can also provide the value "None". In that case, no
            post_delete signal will be attached at all.

    # TODO: Add support
    :param watch_fields: A list of fields in the embedded model to watch
            for changes. If this field is defined, the target model will only
            be updated when one of the listed fields are changed. This only
            applies to saving, since deletion deletes the whole instance.
